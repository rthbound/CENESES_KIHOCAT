# OCR Correction Project

This project is dedicated to correcting text extracted from the Mvskoke translation of the book of Genesis. The goal is to produce a clean, readable copy by identifying and fixing errors introduced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software.

## How to Contribute

### Find an Error
- Consider reviewing commits to see if any mistakes have been made when attempting to correct the text.
- As you review the text, look for mistakes in spelling, spacing, punctuation, or formatting.

### Fix the Error
- Correct misrecognized letters and words.
- Ensure proper word spacing and punctuation.
- Maintain paragraph breaks and overall formatting as much as possible.

### Submit Your Changes
- Edit the text file directly.
- Save your changes.
- Submit them as a new contribution (pull request) on GitHub.

## Guidelines for Editing

### ✅ DO
- Correct clear misreadings.
- Fix obvious word splits, but only if you’re sure of the correction.
- Keep the original formatting (paragraphs, spacing) intact.

### ❌ DON'T
- Relocate or reposition words.
- Remove blank lines unless they are obviously incorrect.
- Modify words unless you're sure they are OCR errors.

## Common OCR Errors & Corrections

Here are some common OCR mistakes to look out for:

- `"cn"` versus `"en"` (e.g., `"cn nvrkvpv"` should be `"en nvrkvpv"`)
- `"fnswv"` versus `"fuswv"`
- `"inake"` versus `"hake"`

## Why Accuracy Matters

The Mvskoke translation of the book of Genesis is a valuable resource for the Mvskoke people and others interested in the language. By correcting OCR errors, we can ensure that the text is accessible and accurate for future generations.

I was taught that those who worked on translating these biblical texts were extremely careful with their work. We should strive to act with the same care and respect for their efforts.
