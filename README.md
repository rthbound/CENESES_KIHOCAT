Remove blank lines unless they are obviously incorrect.

Modify words unless you're sure they are OCR errors.

Common OCR Errors & Corrections

Here are some common OCR mistakes to look out for:

"cn" versus "en" (e.g., "cn nvrkvpv" should be "en nvrkvpv")

"fnswv" versus "fuswv"

"inake" versus "hake"

Why Accuracy Matters

OCR software makes mistakes, especially with certain fonts and letter shapes. Our careful corrections will help produce an accurate, usable text.
